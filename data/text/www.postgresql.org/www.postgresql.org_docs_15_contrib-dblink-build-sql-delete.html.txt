dblink_build_sql_delete
dblink_build_sql_delete — builds a DELETE statement using supplied values for primary key field values


Synopsis

dblink_build_sql_delete(text relname,
                        int2vector primary_key_attnums,
                        integer num_primary_key_atts,
                        text[] tgt_pk_att_vals_array) returns text



Description
dblink_build_sql_delete can be useful in doing selective replication of a local table to a remote database. It builds an SQL DELETE command that will delete the row with the given primary key values.


Arguments


relname

Name of a local relation, for example foo or myschema.mytab. Include double quotes if the name is mixed-case or contains special characters, for example "FooBar"; without quotes, the string will be folded to lower case.

primary_key_attnums

Attribute numbers (1-based) of the primary key fields, for example 1 2.

num_primary_key_atts

The number of primary key fields.

tgt_pk_att_vals_array

Values of the primary key fields to be used in the resulting DELETE command. Each field is represented in text form.





Return Value
Returns the requested SQL statement as text.


Notes
As of PostgreSQL 9.0, the attribute numbers in primary_key_attnums are interpreted as logical column numbers, corresponding to the column's position in SELECT * FROM relname. Previous versions interpreted the numbers as physical column positions. There is a difference if any column(s) to the left of the indicated column have been dropped during the lifetime of the table.


Examples

SELECT dblink_build_sql_delete('"MyFoo"', '1 2', 2, '{"1", "b"}');
           dblink_build_sql_delete
---------------------------------------------
 DELETE FROM "MyFoo" WHERE f1='1' AND f2='b'
(1 row)
