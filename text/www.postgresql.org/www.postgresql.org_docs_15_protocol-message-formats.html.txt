55.7. Message Formats



This section describes the detailed format of each message. Each is marked to indicate that it can be sent by a frontend (F), a backend (B), or both (F & B). Notice that although each message includes a byte count at the beginning, the message format is defined so that the message end can be found without reference to the byte count. This aids validity checking. (The CopyData message is an exception, because it forms part of a data stream; the contents of any individual CopyData message cannot be interpretable on their own.)


AuthenticationOk (B)



Byte1('R')

The name of the destination portal (an empty string selects the unnamed portal).

String

The name of the source prepared statement (an empty string selects the unnamed prepared statement).

Int16

The number of parameter format codes that follow (denoted C below). This can be zero to indicate that there are no parameters or that the parameters all use the default format (text); or one, in which case the specified format code is applied to all parameters; or it can equal the actual number of parameters.

For an INSERT command, the tag is INSERT oid rows, where rows is the number of rows inserted. oid used to be the object ID of the inserted row if rows was 1 and the target table had OIDs, but OIDs system columns are not supported anymore; therefore oid is always 0.

Byte1('d')

Identifies the message as COPY data.

Int32

The database to connect to. Defaults to the user name.

options

Command-line arguments for the backend. (This is deprecated in favor of setting individual run-time parameters.) Spaces within this string are considered to separate arguments, unless escaped with a backslash (\); write \\ to represent a literal backslash.

replication

Used to connect in streaming replication mode, where a small set of replication commands can be issued instead of SQL statements. Value can be true, false, or database, and the default is false. See Section 55.4 for details.



In addition to the above, other parameters may be listed. Parameter names beginning with _pq_. are reserved for use as protocol extensions, while others are treated as run-time parameters to be set at backend start time. Such settings will be applied during backend start (after parsing the command-line arguments if any) and will act as session defaults.
